# WordCounter

WordCounter is a tool for counting the lenght of any text. That's really useful, in example, for posting at social networks that force you to keep short the message!

This app can help you to know the number of paragraphs, sentences, words, characters (without counting spaces) and characters (with spaces) that are contained in your text.
